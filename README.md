# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## Initial Task Instructions

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

Additional Task requirements:
- Use "classname.prototype.*" syntax (not ES2015/ES6 class syntax).
- Make changes only to app.js and submit only this file to the code review.
